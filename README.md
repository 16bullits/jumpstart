# spark-clone

A clone of Laravel Spark, for Rails. All your Rails apps should start off with a bunch of great defaults.

## Getting Started

Spark-clone is a Rails template, so you pass it in as an option when creating a new app.

#### Creating a new app

```bash
rails new myapp -d postgresql -m template.rb
```

#### Cleaning up

```bash
rails db:drop
spring stop
cd ..
rm -rf myapp
```
